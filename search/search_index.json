Remove the build cache","text":"<p>One of the most common causes of unused files and storage is the build cache. I discovered how much space the build cache can take up when I was working on a project that required me to build a lot of Docker images.</p> <p>Thankfully, Docker provides a command to remove the build cache. To do so, use the following command:</p> <pre><code>docker builder prune\n</code></pre> <p>The build cache is used to accelerate the Docker image building process, but most of the time you don't need to keep it when you are going to build a new image for a new project.</p> <p>I saved 25GB of storage space on my workstation by removing the build cache of only one image. \ud83d\ude31</p> <p>Imagine how much space you can save if you remove the build cache after months of working on different projects!</p> <p>By using these Docker commands, you can efficiently manage your workstation's storage, preventing unused files from accumulating and optimizing space for machine learning tasks.</p> <p>Always be cautious when running these commands, as they will delete unused containers, images, networks, volumes, and build cache. Only run them if you are certain you no longer need the resources. With a clean workstation, you'll be better equipped to train your machine learning models using large images and Docker.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/03/29/we-are-all-learners/","title":"We are all learners","text":"<p>In today's fast-paced world of technology, learning and adapting to new developments is essential.

When you share your knowledge with the wider community, you are contributing to the collective knowledge base.  Your blog posts and articles can help others who are also learning about AI or other tech-related topics.  This can be especially helpful for those who are just starting out and may not know where to begin.</p> <p>We are all learners, and we all have something to share.
